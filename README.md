# HIV Data Analysis Dashboard

### Overview
This project aims at analyzing HIV-related data to understand patterns and factors affecting HIV incidence, deaths, treatment coverage, and related policies globally using Dash and Plotly with Python. The following analysis involves:

#### 1. Importing Libraries
Import necessary libraries for data analysis, visualization, and building the dashboard.

#### Libraries:

- dash
- plotly
- pandas
- numpy


#### 2. Data Loading and Inspection
Load HIV-related datasets and inspect the data for cleaning and preprocessing.

#### Data sources:

- [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/programmerrdai/hiv-aids)

- [worldbank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.HIV.ARTC.ZS)

- [prepwatch](https://www.prepwatch.org/resources/global-prep-tracker)

- [hivtravel](https://www.hivtravel.org)


#### 3. Data Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Clean and preprocess the datasets to make them suitable for analysis and visualization. Explore HIV-related data to identify patterns and trends over time and across different regions.

#### 4. Building Interactive Dashboard
Develop an interactive dashboard using Dash and Plotly to visualize key insights from the analysis.
